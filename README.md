# Nef-Negative-Regulatory-Factor-RNA-seq


Nef (Negative Regulatory Factor) is a small 27 35 kDa protein that is coded by the HIV genome.This gene performs several different tasks during infection. However, despite being studied for more than two decades, it was not known how this protein increases the infectivity of new virus particles released from the cell. In the year 2015, two groups of scientists independently solved this 20 year old mystery and shed light on a pair of new genes that could restrict HIV in absence of the Nef protein (Rosa et al. 2015; Usami et al. 2015).

In this mini project we will replicate results from the paper:

Rosa A, Chande A, Ziglio S, De Sanctis V, Bertorelli R, Goh SL, McCauley SM, Nowosielska A, Antonarakis SE, Luban J, et al. 2015. HIV 1 Nef promotes infection by excluding SERINC5 from virion incorporation. Nature 526:212––217.217.

They measured infectivity ratio of these same cell lines with Nef+ and Nef HIV. Using this data, they looked at correlations between expression levels of each gene with the infectivity ratio’s. Genes whose expression level showed a strong correlation with the infectivity ratio were chosen as candidate genes that were involved in restricting the virus in the absence of the Nef gene . Further experimental validation of these candidate genes lead to interesting new discovery that.
